# Vertical Pad

> It's dimensionalist to have only left-pad and right-pad. Let's fix that with vertical-pad.

This module can be used to unify the number of lines in a file, choosing between aligning to the top or bottom.

## Installation

To start using this package, simply install from NPM:

```bash
npm install vertical-pad --save
```
